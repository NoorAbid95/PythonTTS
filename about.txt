- PyPDF is a free and open-source pure-python PDF library capable of retrieving text form a PDF file.


- Google Text-To-Speech is a Python library which uses Google Translates text-to-speech API.
- Picked gTTS because it is easy to use and concise.
- Has the ability to change voice.



- Things I want to add:
1. Make it a webpage.
2. Be able to upload any PDF document.
3. Have a login/logout ability
4. If logged in then be able to listen to all PDFs that you have uploaded.
5. Be able to change the voice (not dire).
